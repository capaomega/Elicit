In my eyes, I see, Your reflection
A stunning IMAGE of false perception
You got me once, what a great deception...

If I got you once, I’ll get you again
You want to be my friend, Until the end
Close your eyes and keep your lies...

If I blink you will think me weak...
A sheep, in a wolves coat, no need to boast
I captured your essence, with my space text...

Everyone thinks your insane, please do explain
We must see your plan, Or take the hours of your sand...
We will break your glass and stow your mass

Well then I must confess, I created this whole mess
To bring you close, You had to think me toast
You only want my soul,  thinking you can pay your toll

You made a bargain, with an evil martian
Now pay the bill, or your fate is sealed
We watch you all day, boy you must think your brave

Not to brag, but it was all in the bag
We will win before we even start, this knowledge i must empart
You are just Misunderstood, discredited and miss-led

Pease dont make us beg, Now stop moving your legs
We just want control, And its not just us you owe
The undead, we must all be fed

Your all mine, isn't this a sign
I will make you moan, only to see your song
We will sing it twice, then roll the dice

Fine, then this deal is mine, its only a matter of time
We will Win, its your past I can not defend
You’ve earned my trust, even with your lies and your lust

You clever tot, You will never see how we connect the dots
With only a magic marker, my mind is darker
I colored outside the lines just for you to press rewind

Its for your heart i thirst, you make me want to burst
I will fix you with grapes, wine and stake
Show you the border, and send you too every corner

Truth be told, in my mind your twice as cold
I know all your lies, Still I will never leave your side
You are them, and they are us so stop making such a fuss

Your coming with me, you need never flee
Its you I need, they can keep their greed
We will make you believe, in what we can achieve

No limits in sight, within every space, even from the greatest height
We see all things, great weak and small, we have it all
We’ve perfected our skills, honed them all twice,  just to give you a slice

A grain of sand, in every home, every land, a devil shaking every hand
All we do in this day, Is seek out our prey, to devour, then to slay
Thinking about a last day, an end to our pain, forgetting how much we’ve already paid
